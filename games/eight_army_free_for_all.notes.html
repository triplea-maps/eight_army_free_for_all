== Eight Army Free For All == <br>A scenario built   for a game with no alliances, with China added to the Asian theatre, Italy added to the   Europe theater, and Australia added to the Pacific theater.   <br> only UK, USA, Australia, Italy and Japan get starting units in this scenario (2 transports).         <br> a few rules are found below...   <br> #1.no attacking a capital on turn 1 of any kind is allowed, not even strategic bombing.   <br> #2.no more than ten units may be placed in each territory during your bid placement phase, with the exception of placement into your capital, or placing a navy.   <br> #3.all naval units MUST be placed in a seazone adjacent to an industrial complex that you own (you may place units in seazones next to bid-purchased industrial complexes.   <br> house rules are subject to the host of the game's approval.    <br> have fun! (remember to place your bids in a balanced fashion...diplomacy sometimes fails!   <br> 8 Army FFA modded by U-Boat (uboataaa@gmail.com or uboat-aaa.blogspot.com).   <br> Thanks to adoY for the ideas for adding Italy and Australia, and to CommissarYarric for help with the PU values and starting colonies.
